# FilmQueryProject

# Description

This project hold a simple search function through a database of 1000 films. Upon starting the program, the user is prompted with a menu to search for information on a film by entering either an ID number of the film, or free typing into the search function, which searches through the titles and descriptions of each movie in the database. When a film is displayed, the program shows the films title, release year, rating, language, description, and actor list. If multiple films are found through a keyword search, then the movies number of movies found is also displayed.

# What I Learned

The project helped me to learn a lot about databases, and using my existing Java knowledge to access different information and tables in a database. Also, despite my best effort, each new project seems to trick me into getting more comfortable with Object Oriented Programming in general.

In terms of OOP, I realized that I can follow the OOP principles better by having each film object hold its own list of actors, and when I display that list for the search, I call the list from the film being displayed. At the start of the project, I wasn't storing this list anywhere, and to display the actors I was calling a method which was immediately printed out. For the scope of this project, I don't think it makes any difference which way I actually display the list, but I recognized that if I wanted to do more with this code, it would be very helpful to have each film store its own actor list. I figured it was worth the time to spend a couple extra minutes to build good OOP habits.

For databases, I got a lot of good experience with MySQL searches. It was fun to see how many different ways you can get the same information from a table, and to practice using prepared statements. As our last week of class has largely focused on databases and MySQL, it was really enjoyable to get back to using Java, too.
